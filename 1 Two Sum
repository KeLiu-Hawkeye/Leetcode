Leetcode 1 Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

======== solution =========
We use dictionary to record value:index. For each value in array, we check whther Targer-value is in dictionary or not:
  if Target-value is not in dictionary, we add value:index into dictionary
  if Target-value is in dictionary, we find the solution. Return [index[value] and index[Target-value]]
if no solution is found, we will return.



def two_sum(array, T):
  if not array or type(T) != int:
    return
  visited={} # dictionary
  for idx,value in enumerate(array):
    if T-value not in visited:  # if Target-value is not in dictionary, add value:index into dictioanry
      visited[value]=idx
    else:       # if Target-value is in dictionary, we find the solution. Return the indecis of value and Target-value
      return [idx,visited[T-value]]
  return 
print two_sum([2,7,11,15],9)
